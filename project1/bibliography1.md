Geographic routing in social networks was written in 2005, and attempts to improve the traditional small world model by taking into account geography. They develop a rank-based friendship model. They use data from LiveJournal to validate thier model. There is currently far more data about online social networks, and larger networks, than there was in 2005. It is plausible to take their results and apply them on a larger scale, and see if their conclusions hold true, or how they fail.
