Stratocumulus clouds help reflect sunlight out of the atmosphere, and have  some influence on climate change. The paper uses a cellular network to model the evolution of a cloud from a set of starting conditions. The model is primarily an attempt to explain cloud structure, and the authors believe that it is an improvement over existing methods.
