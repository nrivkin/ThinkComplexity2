Helbing and Yu investigate the emergence of cooperative behavior among competitive agents when non-cooperative behavior is a dominant strategy. They use the prisoners dilemma as a model for such interactions. They make the argument that the common solution to the dilemma, iteration, is not able to account for changing situations, or deal with a noisy environment. They construct an agent based model to create a more realistic model, implementing changing strategies, noise, and changing spatial dynamics. They find that introducing migration aids in the emergence of cooperation, even though individual agents no longer interact with the same set of other agents repeatedly.
