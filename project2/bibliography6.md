Zhaa, Zhou, and Zhou model large-scale online collaborative efforts such as Wikipedia editing. They look at individual behavoir, group responses and community growth. They find that responses follow a power-law distribution. They conduct mathematical analysis of real data from Wikipedia. A similar procedure could be conducted with other collaborative online projects.
